# OWASP API Security Testing Framework Overview

## What This Framework Does

The OWASP API Security Testing Framework (ASTF) is a comprehensive tool designed to identify security vulnerabilities in APIs based on the OWASP API Security Top 10. Unlike traditional security tools, ASTF specifically focuses on API-specific vulnerabilities that are often missed by general-purpose scanners.

## How It Works

The framework operates using a black-box testing approach:

1. **Endpoint Discovery**: Automatically discovers API endpoints through:
    - OpenAPI/Swagger specification parsing
    - Common endpoint pattern testing
    - Intelligent path traversal
    - Manual endpoint specification

2. **Security Testing**: Executes a comprehensive suite of tests targeting:
    - API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization
    - API2:2023 - Broken Authentication
    - API3:2023 - Excessive Data Exposure
    - API4:2023 - Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
    - API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization
    - (Additional test cases in future releases)

3. **Vulnerability Reporting**: Provides detailed findings including:
    - Severity classification
    - Vulnerability details
    - Evidence capture
    - Remediation guidance
    - References to OWASP standards

## Key Capabilities

### Dynamic API Testing

* Tests live API endpoints without needing source code
* Detects vulnerabilities through intelligent request manipulation
* Identifies security issues that affect APIs specifically

### Authentication & Authorization Testing

* Tests for improper access controls
* Detects weak authentication mechanisms
* Identifies JWT vulnerabilities
* Tests for privilege escalation

### Data Protection Analysis

* Identifies sensitive data exposure
* Detects missing encryption
* Finds excessive data in responses

### Resource Protection

* Tests for missing rate limiting
* Identifies DoS vulnerabilities
* Detects resource consumption issues

### Integration Capabilities

* CI/CD pipeline integration
* SARIF output for security dashboards
* HTML reports for stakeholders
* Command-line interface for scripting

## Use Cases

### Development Teams

* Test APIs during development
* Integrate security testing into CI/CD pipelines
* Validate security controls before deployment

### Security Teams

* Assess API security posture
* Validate vendor API security
* Perform regular security assessments

### DevSecOps

* Automate API security testing
* Generate compliance evidence
* Track security improvements over time

## Technical Architecture

The framework is built on a modular Java architecture:

* **Core Engine**: Manages test execution and coordination
* **HTTP Client**: Handles API communications and request manipulation
* **Test Cases**: Modular, extensible security tests
* **Reporting Engine**: Generates findings in multiple formats
* **CLI Interface**: Provides user interaction and configuration

## Intended Audience

The ASTF is designed for:

* Security engineers
* API developers
* DevOps engineers
* Security consultants
* Quality assurance testers

No deep security expertise is required to run basic scans, but security knowledge helps interpret results and implement fixes.
